Wisdom is only possessed by those whom give up their desires.
If you feel like crushed under your sorrow, rise up like a tree.
There has never been such a man whom is both lazy and wise.
Women only respect a man whom can carry his weight. Do not falter.
The most important thing for one is to find a path, and walk it.
A man can never be strong, unless he is also pure of heart.
A tiger never worries, why should you?
Do not get burned by the fire in your heart, but never extinguish it.
Gather energy and amplify it. Be the change.
Beggars can be choosers. Do not let others make your choices.
Do not let your hate crush you. Empower your iron fist of doom with it.
This world is filled with weaklings. Climb over them.
Strength cannot be conjured. It must be built.
